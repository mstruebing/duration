## Why?

If you have processes which takes a bit longer, especially if you know round about how much time it takes to complete, it is cool to know how long the process is already running.

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruebing/duration/master/example/example.gif "example")

## Usage

```sh 
USAGE: duration [h|help|v|version|<command>]
where
        [v|version] - prints the version
        [h|help] - prints the help
        <command> - a SINGLE command or script to execute

would work:
        duration sleep 5
        duration script.sh
would NOT work:
        duration sleep 5 && sleep 4
```


### Important

It's __important__ to understand that currently only a __single__  command with or without arguments can be executed. If you are chaining commands with `||` or `&&` or for example, you need to put your command into a script and execute that.
